# ReVision

> A new take on revision

An app I'm working on in my free time. At the moment it has no function whatsoever.

## Notes
- Daily prompts to ask what they've learnt during lesson
  - at end of lesson, prompt for what they've learnt in lesson
  - NLP to parse phrases like "started chapter 4", "finished plant nutrition", etc (?)
  - every weekend or so, summarise what they've learnt
  - facilitates revision
  - When prompting, ask for which specific section of the subject
  - Ask to take photos of the section notes
  - Allows for revision on the go
- Early study prompts
  - Allow users to add quizzes/tests/exams to their schedule
  - specify what part of what subject is being tested
  - provide interval study reminders
